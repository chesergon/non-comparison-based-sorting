# Non-Comparison-Based Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to the repository of non-comparison-based algorithms implemented in JavaScript. This collection focuses on algorithms that do not rely on direct comparisons between elements, such as counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort. These algorithms are particularly useful for specific types of data and can offer better performance than traditional comparison-based algorithms in certain scenarios.

## Introduction

Non-comparison-based algorithms sort elements without directly comparing them with each other. Instead, they utilize the properties of the data, such as digits or counts, to achieve sorting. These algorithms can achieve linear time complexity under certain conditions, making them efficient for large datasets with specific characteristics.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Counting Sort**
2. **Radix Sort**
3. **Bucket Sort**

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file with detailed comments explaining the logic and steps involved.

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/non-comparison-based-algorithms.git
